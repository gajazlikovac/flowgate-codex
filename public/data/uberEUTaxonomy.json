Short-term leases (€3.2M in current reporting period) are appropriately included in OpEx calculations, while additions to right-of-use assets (€22.6M) are captured in CapEx figures, maintaining consistency with financial statements while adhering to Taxonomy disclosure requirements.\"\n\nOur approach to lease cost treatment includes:\n- Clear distinction between short-term leases (included in OpEx) and right-of-use assets (included in CapEx)\n- Specific general ledger accounts to identify and track each lease type\n- Quarterly reconciliation between Taxonomy reporting and financial statements\n- Documented verification procedures to confirm appropriate classification\n- Consistent application across all business units and reporting periods\n- Alignment with the specific guidance provided in Annex I of the Article 8 Delegated Act\n\nThis methodology ensures that lease costs are appropriately considered in our Taxonomy calculations without double-counting between OpEx and CapEx KPIs.

We have verified the relevance of these sources through specific mapping between information elements and our business context, with validation by operational teams regarding applicability to our specific facilities and customer relationships, and ensure information currency through annual review of all sources with formal update requirements for any guidance older than two years. Our methodology development considered multiple perspectives by triangulating information from different source types, giving particular weight to operational data that directly reflects our actual facility performance, and specifically applied this information to methodology elements such as allocation models (based on industry best practices), estimation techniques (validated against actual operational data), and boundary settings (aligned with regulatory guidance and industry standards). We maintain information appropriateness through a formal information management process that includes horizon scanning for new guidance, regular consultation with industry experts, and prompt methodology updates when significant new information becomes available, ensuring our approach remains grounded in the most current and relevant information sources.",

The assessment uses defined thresholds, stakeholder input, and strategic relevance to ensure focused disclosure on truly material capital information that supports stakeholder understanding and decision-making.\"\n\nMateriality Threshold Application, Section 3.2\n\"Material capital elements are identified using both quantitative and qualitative criteria: 1) Financial significance threshold of >3% of total capital base or >1.5% of annual financing activity, 2) Strategic relevance to sustainability objectives and Taxonomy implementation, 3) Explicit stakeholder interest identified through engagement activities, and 4) Forward-looking significance for environmental transition. Each capital element undergoes systematic assessment against these criteria with documented rationale for materiality determination.\"\n\nStakeholder-Informed Materiality Analysis, Page 17\n\"Material capital elements identified through our assessment include: sustainability-linked financing facilities (€175M), green bonds allocated to Taxonomy-aligned activities (€250M), capital allocation constraints affecting environmental performance, strategic equity raises for low-carbon infrastructure, and financing structures supporting our climate transition plan. Less material elements with limited disclosure include routine administrative banking arrangements, short-term liquidity management, and generic treasury operations not significantly impacting strategic or sustainability outcomes.\"\n\nOur approach to ensuring capital information materiality includes:\n- Comprehensive double materiality assessment considering both financial and impact perspectives\n- Clearly defined thresholds with both quantitative and qualitative dimensions\n- Systematic evaluation of each capital element against materiality criteria\n- Stakeholder engagement to understand information needs and expectations\n- Independent validation of materiality determinations by external experts\n- Documentation of rationale for both inclusion and exclusion decisions\n- Regular reassessment as business strategies and stakeholder interests evolve\n\nThis structured approach ensures our capital disclosure focuses on truly relevant information while avoiding unnecessary detail on immaterial elements.

Less material impacts include office waste generation, employee commuting emissions, and packaging materials, which scored below our materiality threshold due to limited scale and environmental significance relative to our core operations. We have validated our materiality determination through independent review by environmental consultants, benchmarking against industry peers, scientific literature review on impact significance, and verification against recognized reporting frameworks (GRI, SASB), and review it annually through formal reassessment and quarterly through emerging issues analysis to ensure continued focus on relevant environmental effects. Our assessment also incorporates dynamic materiality concepts, identifying biodiversity impacts and embodied carbon in equipment as emerging issues that may become material in future reporting cycles, demonstrating forward-looking governance of environmental impacts.",

Understandability is further enhanced through clear structure, visual data presentation, technical term explanations, and stakeholder-tested formatting.\"\n\nOur approach to balanced impact disclosure includes:\n- Alignment of disclosure detail with impact materiality ensuring proportionate coverage\n- Neutral language and factual presentation verified through editorial review process\n- Multi-dimensional contextualization providing relevant reference points for significance interpretation\n- Transparent discussion of both environmental challenges and improvement initiatives\n- Consistent structure and formatting across impact categories to prevent emphasis bias\n- Complementary quantitative metrics and qualitative significance explanation\n- Stakeholder-tested presentation formats optimized for understanding\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures our negative impact disclosure neither exaggerates nor minimizes our environmental effects but presents them with appropriate objectivity and context. The disclosure enables stakeholders to understand both absolute performance and relative significance of our environmental impacts. Our stakeholder understanding testing confirms that diverse audience groups including investors, customers, regulators, and environmental specialists can accurately interpret the significance of our environmental effects based on our disclosure.",

We have assessed the materiality of these gaps as high for climate scenario quantification, moderate for value chain risk assessment, and low for granular transition risk classification based on both stakeholder interest and regulatory implementation timelines, and developed remediation plans including implementation of an enhanced scenario analysis capability using specialized climate risk modeling, development of a supplier and customer risk assessment framework, and refinement of our transition risk taxonomy, with implementation by Q3 2024 for transition risk classification, Q1 2025 for enhanced scenario analysis, and Q3 2025 for comprehensive value chain risk assessment. Interim measures include qualitative climate scenario assessments, partial value chain risk screening with clear boundary disclosure, and simplified transition risk categorization while we work toward full compliance. Our progress on previously identified compliance gaps includes successful implementation of physical risk assessment according to 2022 guidelines (identified as a gap last year and now fully remediated), enhanced double materiality risk evaluation (75% complete against 2023 goals), and expanded governance disclosure related to risk oversight (100% complete against 2023 targets).

These gaps have been assessed for materiality to ensure appropriate prioritization of compliance efforts.\"\n\nGap Severity Classification and Justification, Section 3.2\n\"Our analysis applies a structured framework classifying compliance gaps by severity and constraint type: 1) Methodological Gap - climate scenario risk quantification at the detailed financial level specified in draft ESRS E1 requires enhanced modeling capabilities beyond our current methodology; 2) Data Availability Constraint - complete value chain risk assessment under emerging CSRD guidance requires expanded information gathering from suppliers and customers not yet fully implemented; and 3) Technical Gap - granular transition risk classification according to recent EFRAG technical standards requires refined taxonomy development as final standards are being finalized. Each constraint is supported by specific evidence demonstrating reasonable limitation rather than willful omission.\"\n\nCompliance Pathway and Remediation Planning, Page 14\n\"Our comprehensive compliance strategy addresses each identified gap with specific actions, responsible owners, and implementation milestones: 1) Enhanced Climate Scenario Analysis will implement specialized financial modeling capabilities by Q1 2025 with methodology development beginning Q3 2024; 2) Value Chain Risk Assessment Framework will develop supplier and customer risk evaluation systems by Q3 2025 with phased implementation beginning Q1 2025; and 3) Transition Risk Taxonomy will refine our classification system by Q3 2024 aligning with finalized technical standards. Each pathway includes regulatory monitoring to incorporate evolving guidance as standards are finalized.\"\n\nOur approach to managing regulatory non-compliance includes:\n- Clear identification of specific non-compliant disclosure elements\n- Structured explanation of compliance constraints with supporting evidence\n- Materiality assessment determining significance of each compliance gap\n- Comprehensive remediation planning with specific action items\n- Defined implementation timelines with interim milestones\n- Designated executive accountabilities for compliance achievement\n- Interim measures providing alternative information where possible\n\nWhile working toward full compliance, we have implemented appropriate interim measures including qualitative climate scenario assessments with clear methodology disclosure, partial value chain risk screening with boundary definition, and simplified transition risk categorization based on current best practices. These measures ensure stakeholders have the most comprehensive view possible within current constraints. Our disclosure also includes progress updates on previously identified compliance gaps, demonstrating our commitment to continuous improvement in regulatory alignment.
